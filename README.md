# DevOps-Git
Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS) that is commonly used for tracking changes in source code during software development. Git provides a robust and efficient way to manage and collaborate on projects, making it an essential tool for developers.  
Participants will gain the skills needed to effectively use Git for version control in software development projects, collaborate with others, and troubleshoot common issues. The depth and complexity of these topics can vary depending on the course's level (beginner, intermediate, or advanced).
