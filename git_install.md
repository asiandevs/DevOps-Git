# Install Git Client on Linux

To work with Git on a Linux-based system, you can use your distribution's package manager to install the Git client. Follow the instructions below for your specific Linux distribution

## CentOS/RHEL:

```bash
sudo yum install git
```

After executing the appropriate command for your distribution, Git and its dependencies will be installed. To verify the installation, run:

```bash
git --version
```

This will display the installed Git version. If you see the Git version, it means Git has been successfully installed on your Linux system. You can now start using Git for version control and collaboration on your projects.
```
